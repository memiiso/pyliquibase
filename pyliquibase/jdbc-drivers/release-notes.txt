Magnitude Simba Google BigQuery JDBC Data Connector Release Notes 
============================================================================== 

The release notes provide details of enhancements, features, known issues, and 
workflow changes in Simba Google BigQuery JDBC Connector 1.2.22, as well as 
the version history. 


1.2.22 =======================================================================

Released 2022-02-07

Enhancements & New Features 
 
 * [GBQJ-466][GBQJ-488][GBQJ-525][GBQJ-526][GBQJ-535] Third-party library 
   updates

   The connector has been updated with the following third-party libraries:
   - google-cloud-bigquerystorage 2.8.3 (previously 2.5.1)
   - avro 1.11.0 (previously 1.10.2)
   - commons-compress 1.21 (previously 1.20)
   
 * [GBQJ-524] Internal connector improvements

   The connector has been updated with minor internal improvements. 
 

Known Issues
The following are known issues that you may encounter due to limitations in
the data source, the connector, or an application.

 * The connector does not support parameterized types for Resultset and 
   Parameter metadata. 

   This is a limitation of the Google BigQuery server. 

 * Connector terminates when multiple connections are set to LogLevel=6.
  
   When multiple connections with the same LogPath directory are running with
   LogLevel set to 6, a collision might happen. This results in one of the 
   connections terminating unexpectedly. 

 * The connector no longer supports parameters in the exception block.
   
   This is a limitation of the Google BigQuery server discovered on Mar 2021.

 * TRACE level logs incorrectly contain stack trace for function entrances.

   When logging at the TRACE level (LogLevel=6), function entrance logs are 
   generated for each function that is called. These logs incorrectly 
   include a stack trace.

 * Query prefixes are not supported.

   The driver does not support query prefixes. To specify whether your query
   statements are to be processed using standard SQL or legacy BigQuery SQL, 
   configure the QueryDialect connection property. 

   By default, QueryDialect is set to "SQL" so that the driver uses standard
   SQL syntax. To use BigQuery SQL instead, set the property to "BIG_QUERY".

 * Support for ODBC Escape Sequences is limited.

   The only supported ODBC Escape Sequences are Scalar Functions of the form 
   {fn func(args)} if func is supported by the Google BigQuery data source 
   engine. 

 * When casting data, you must specify the data type according to Google 
   BigQuery standards.

   When casting data to a specific data type, you must use the corresponding 
   data type name shown in the "Casting" section of the Query Reference:
   https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/sql-reference/functions-and-operators#casting. 

   For example, to cast the "salary" column to the INTEGER type, you must 
   specify INT64 instead of INTEGER: 

      SELECT position, CAST(salary AS INT64) from Employee


Workflow Changes =============================================================

The following changes may disrupt established workflows for the connector.


1.2.20 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

 * [GBQJ-439] Updated Timeout property 

   The description of the Timeout property has been updated. For more 
   information, see the Installation and Configuration Guide.


1.2.14 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

 * [GBQJ-435] MaxResults default value

   Beginning with this release, MaxResults now defaults to 10,000. The 
   previous default (0) of unlimited rows would cause an increase in query
   execution time in many scenarios. For more information, see the 
   Installation and Configuration Guide.


1.2.2 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Removed support for JDBC 4.1 (Java 7)

   Beginning with this release, the driver no longer supports JDBC 4.1 (Java 
   7). For a list of supported JDBC versions, see the Installation and 
   Configuration Guide.


Version History ==============================================================

1.2.21 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Released 2021-10-28

Enhancements & New Features 
 
 * [GBQJ-497] EnableSession support
   
   You can now create a session ID from the first executed query on a 
   connection. To do this, set the EnableSession property to 1. For more 
   information, see the Installation and Configuration Guide.

 * [GBQJ-516] UnsupportedHTAPIFallback support
  
   You can now set the connector to fall back to the REST API when using 
   fetch workflows not supported on the High-Throughput API. To do this, set
   the UnsupportedHTAPIFallback property to 1. For more information, see the 
   Installation and Configuration Guide.

 * [GBQJ-496] INTERVAL data type support 

   The connector now has limited support for the INTERVAL data type. For more
   information, see the Installation and Configuration Guide and the Google
   BigQuery documentation: 
   https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-types#interval_type.
  
   The INTERVAL data type cannot be retrieved through the High-Throughput API.
   The default connector behavior is to fallback to the REST API for this 
   data. To disable this fallback, set the UnsupportedHTAPIFallback property 
   to 0. 
   

1.2.20 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Released 2021-09-30
  
Resolved Issues
The following issues have been resolved in Simba Google BigQuery JDBC 
Connector 1.2.20.

 * [GBQJ-497] When executing a script and DefaultLargeResultDataset or 
   DefaultLargeResultTable is configured, the connector terminates 
   unexpectedly.

 * [GBQJ-503] When single-line comments contain DDL/DML commands using two
   dashes ( -- ), the connector returns a null pointer exception.

 * [GBQJ-507] When a query has more than 40 hyphens before the first 
   statement, the connector becomes unresponsive.


1.2.19 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Released 2021-07-30

Enhancements & New Features 

 * [GBQJ-438] Multi-statement transactions support

   The connector now supports multi-statement transactions. For more
   information, see: 
   https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/transactions

 * [GBQJ-460] New MetaDataFetchThreadCount property

   You can now control the number of threads used to call a DatabaseMetaData
   method. To do this, set the MetaDataFetchThreadCount property to the
   desired number of threads. For more information, see the Installation and
   Configuration Guide.

 * [GBQJ-460] Improved performance for metadata functions
   
   Improvements in parallelization and new design have been made to the 
   following metadata functions: 
   - getColumns
   - getFunctions
   - getFunctionColumns
   - getProcedures
   - getProcedureColumns
   - getSchemas
   - getTables

 * [GBQJ-460] Data control language support

   The connector now supports data control language. For more
   information, see: 
   https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-control-language

 * [GBQJ-489] Third-party library update

   The connector has been updated with the following third-party libraries:
   - google-api-client 1.32.1 (previously 1.31.4)
   - google-api-services-bigquery v2-rev20210617-1.32.1 (previously
     v2-rev20210410-1.31.0)
   - google-cloud-bigquery 1.137.0 (previously 1.128.1)
   - google-cloud-bigquerystorage 1.23.0 (previously 1.20.2)
  

1.2.18 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Released 2021-06-30

Enhancements & New Features 

 * [GBQJ-473] Updated job retry behaviour

   Retrying job executions has been improved to prevent read timeout errors. 

 * [GBQJ-467] Parameterized data types support

   The connector now supports parameterized data types. For metadata 
   functions, DatabaseMetaData.getColumns() returns the size, length, 
   precision, and scale related to these types.

   Due to current limitations of the BigQuery server with providing metadata 
   for result sets and parameters, the connector does not provide specific 
   information (size, scale, etc.) in some cases. In these cases, the 
   connector returns the default value. Also, due to JDBC limitations, the
   connector can only return STRING and BYTE lengths up to 32-bit.

   For example:
   CREATE TABLE Test(str STRING(100));

   DatabaseMetaData.getColumns() returns the correct value of 100 for the size
   and buffer length. However, ResultSet.getMetadata() returns the default 
   string length that has been set for the connector. 


Resolved Issues
The following issues have been resolved in Simba Google BigQuery JDBC 
Connector 1.2.18.

  * [GBQJ-472] When authenticating with a service account and only an access
    token is provided, the connector returns an error. 
  
  * [GBQJ-470] LargeResultTable contains a period in some languages, resulting
    in an invalid table name. 
    
    This issue has been resolved. The "day of week" name has been removed from 
    the timestamp. 

  * [GBQJ-475] When using SQL dialect, the destination tables are not properly
    created.


1.2.16 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Released 2021-05-07

Enhancements & New Features 

 * [GBQJ-449] Support for service account keyfile
 
   You can now use a keyfile for a service account. To do this, set the 
   OAuthPvtKey property to the file path of the .p12 or .json keyfile, or a 
   raw JSON keyfile object. For more information, see the Installation and 
   Configuration Guide.

 * [GBQJ-432] Setting individual connection properties 
 
   Connection properties can now be individually set through the DataSource
   object. Previously, you could only pass a connection URL to the DataSource
   to make a connection. For more information, see the Installation and 
   Configuration Guide.

 * [GBQJ-444] Updated user agent branding

   The user agent shown when using the connector is now 
   SimbaJDBCDriverforGoogleBigQuery/x.x (GPN:Simba;). Previously, it was
   BigQueryJDBCDriver/x.x (GPN:Simba;). 

 * [GBQJ-450] Updated temporary table name

   A randomized ID is now added to the end of the temporary table name. For 
   more information, see the Installation and Configuration Guide.

 * [GBQJ-455] Third-party library update
 
   The connector has been updated with the following third-party libraries:
   - avro 1.10.2 (previously 1.10.1)
   - google-api-client 1.31.4 (previously 1.31.1)
   - google-api-services-bigquery v2-rev20210410-1.31.0 (previously 
     v2-rev20201030-1.31.0)

Connector 1.2.16.

 * [GBQJ-445] When querying scripts that start with the WITH keyword, the 
   connector terminates unexpectedly. 

 * [GBQJ-443] In some cases, when inserting a NULL value using 
   PreparedStatement.setObject(), the connector terminates unexpectedly. 


1.2.14 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Released 2021-02-26

Enhancements & New Features 

 * [GBQJ-406] Improved query performance
 
   The connector now uses the BigQuery jobs.query API for better end-to-end 
   query times when executing most queries. The following cases are excluded:
   - Parameterized queries
   - Queries which require the use of a destination table for large results
   - Scripting


Resolved Issues
The following issue has been resolved in Simba Google BigQuery JDBC Connector
